            In the existing learning system all the students are required to
            <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">gather at a common location at a 
            particular time</b> to attend the lectures, because of which it lacks <b>
            Geographical independence</b> and <b>Time independence.</b> The students must 
            attend the training classes as per the pre-defined schedule and they need to 
            contact the training administrator if they desire to do a course and wait for 
            the administrator to grant permission for taking the course Since the evaluation 
            of test papers is done manually it takes more time and there is a chance that 
            errors may creep in during the evaluation.

            The students cannot pursue a course of his/her choice at any time, as the 
            training for that course may not be available at that instant. The student has 
            to wait for the training to conclude even if he/she is familiar with the course 
            content and wants to write the test and they even need to contact the training 
            staff for the study material and test result details. Since the details of all 
            the students who are undergoing training are maintained manually it is difficult 
            to search for required details and generate reports.<p>
